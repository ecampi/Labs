The Open Source Definition: Most of the points with the definitions made sense to me and fit into what I already know about open source 
software, but I did learn some new things about the open source license and how it cannot be specific to a product or restrict any other
software. I now see that all of these 10 factors of open source software are very important.

How To Ask Questions The Smart Way: This article has a lot of very helpful and true tips on how and where to ask a question. I've been 
mostly following these tips when I have CS questions. Usually, I follow the tip of looking up the question before I post it anywhere. I 
am usually able to find an answer online, but if I can't I go to the discussion forum of the class or assignment. The tips on how to title 
a question were also insightful. When I am helping someone with a CS question, one of my main things I make sure I do is stay calm and 
make the person I am helping know that there is a solution that they will get to. It is helpful when struggling with something to know 
that there is a solution, and all we have to do is find it. The second thing that I do when helping someone or answering a question is not
directly telling them the answer but setting them off in the right direction to find the answer themselves. I think that if you just give 
someone the solution, they won't be able to solve a similar problem in the future but if you point them in the right direction it allows 
them to learn. 

Free Culture chapter 3: I thought this story is very interesting. He seemed just like any other student at rpi who finds a problem and is 
interested in finding a solution using what they learned in classes. It is very exciting to use information learned and apply it to a 
problem, and then see the solution help out others. I think that the reasons that the people who were accusing him were invalid and should
not have been brought up. This makes me wonder what kinds of code or changes rpi students are restricted to writing, and if this is fair at 
all. We come to a place where we learn to help others and make life simpler/better using science. What the student in the article did was
exactly that, and I am curious to see if that type of development is still not allowed now. I think that it should be allowed because 
it is fun and exciting to make new software that has good intentions and helps other students. 

Beautiful Code: I think that this reading is very interesting because I remember learning about regular expressions in some classes at
rpi, and reviewing it before interviews and math exams. The C code was also pretty interesting to look at and learn about.
