Exercise00:
Everything in this exercise worked for me, but it took a very long time. The docker download took a very long time too

Exercise01:
Everything in this exercise also worked except for the last step which was to run the cowsay funciton. It kept saying that it could not
find the command and I tried many things to try to get this working, but it would not run. After this example, I also had another error 
with git not running that took a very long time to fix. I ended up having to redo the cloning the repository which took a while and 
redoing the stuff before I started exercise00.

Exercise02:
For this exercise, the docker ps and docker images commands worked, but none of the others worked.
