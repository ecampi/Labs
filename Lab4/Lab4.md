3. It is important to choose a license because this allows people to contribute in a way that fits the original creator's ideas for what the project is and how it can be run. It also gives a set definition of rules to follow so that everyone can make sure they are not violating the values and goals of the project. A license defines the project as a certain type of open source, and protects the creator's work. Every license allows and restricts different things for the project that make up what it is. 

4. When working on a project without a license, there is not a defined set of rules or guidelines on what types of changes someone can make, or how someone’s changes are protected. This is important in open source because if a project is handled wrong, it is not open source. Not having a license gives little structure to a project and what can be done with it.

5. I agree with what this article said. The way that the Gopher project was described made it seem unorganized and constantly changing. Once a project gets large, it is probably not a good idea to make sudden changes to the base values and structure of the project. Also, when a project is trying to make a profit, it should make sure that it can’t be forked a bunch of times and changed like the gopher project was. This problem could have probably been fixed with a certain type of license. It is important for the founders of a project to think ahead and see what types of changes might happen in the future so they can prevent things like this from happening.

6. Looking at the license for Linux: This license allows commercial use. When Linux systems were first created, they were sold so this is an important factor in the license. As more flavors of Linux were developed, it was important for the developers to make their changes avaliable to everyone since this is part of the license. This license allowed code to be reused in new systems, as long as the new system was released under the same or a similar license which kept all different Linux versions protected under the same rules, and allowed easy access to people's changes.
