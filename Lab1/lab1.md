The Open Source Definition: Most of the points with the definitions made sense to me and fit into what I already know about open source 
software, but I did learn some new things about the open source license and how it cannot be specific to a product or restrict any other
software. I now see that all of these 10 factors of open source software are very important.

How To Ask Questions The Smart Way: This article has a lot of very helpful and true tips on how and where to ask a question. I've been 
mostly following these tips when I have CS questions. Usually, I follow the tip of looking up the question before I post it anywhere. I 
am usually able to find an answer online, but if I can't I go to the discussion forum of the class or assignment. The tips on how to title 
a question were also insightful. When I am helping someone with a CS question, one of my main things I make sure I do is stay calm and 
make the person I am helping know that there is a solution that they will get to. It is helpful when struggling with something to know 
that there is a solution, and all we have to do is find it. The second thing that I do when helping someone or answering a question is not
directly telling them the answer but setting them off in the right direction to find the answer themselves. I think that if you just give 
someone the solution, they won't be able to solve a similar problem in the future but if you point them in the right direction it allows 
them to learn.
