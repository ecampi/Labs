### Checkpoint 2:


I was not able to get this working. I am not completly sure what was wrong, but the example in the tutorial worked fine. I was able to understand and look at the code provided there. Here is the screenshot from the output of that:

Every time I tried to change something, it gave me an error like this:

I tried changing many different parts of the code to see if I could get it to display the images but there was always some error with the range. I also looked back at the tutorial to see if it gave any pointers on this type of task but I didn't find anything.

### Checkpoint 3:

I'm not sure why I am getting so many errors with this code, but whenever I tired to do anything with an image, the code would either not print out what was in the print statement, or return an error. I looked up these errors, and asked other people if they were having similar errors but I couldn't find a solution. At the end of the code I was trying to resize and view the new images that I imported (I used the three that were given in github) but the code just would not do anything for some reason.
